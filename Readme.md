# Book Management System

Book Management System is a simple web application that allows users to manage a collection of books. With this application, users can add, delete, find and update book records in a MySQL database.

The application provides basic CRUD functionality for book management, allowing users to create new books, retrieve books by ID, update existing books and delete books. The book data is stored in a MySQL database, making it easy to manage and retrieve data.

This application is built using Go programming language and leverages the powerful web framework, mux, for routing. The MySQL database is managed using GORM, which provides a high-level, object-relational mapping interface to the database.

The project can be used as a starting point for building more complex book management systems or as a standalone application for managing a personal collection of books.
